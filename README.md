# personal_projects
Some of my personal projects, including:

1. Sorter: takes input file with random numbers and outputs file containing sorted numbers (lowest to highest). Implements merge sorting.
   
2. Group Calculator: takes symmetry group Sn (permutation), some cycles, and outputs the composition with graph.
